# Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can obtain your own free API key by visiting the OpenAI website. You will need to replace "YOUR API KEY" with the key you obtained and add it to the designated field. 

## The tools I have used to gain the Android Clean Architecture are:

- MMVM
- Retrofit
- Room
- Live Data & Flow
- Dagger2 & Hilt
- Data Layer
